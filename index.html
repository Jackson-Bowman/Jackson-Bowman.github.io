                                        achievement for changing the name of the Captain (player character). The idea behind it is to encourage
                                        players to change their name from the default to something more unique and identifiable,
                                        making any future interactions with the support team a bit easier. The other achievement was created to
                                        reward high-commitment players who had maxed out their reputation with the game's various factions.
                                        Both of these achievments also involved writing scripts to award the achievements to players who had
                                        already reached the respective milestones prior to their addition to the game client. </p>

                                    It was made in close cooperation with the design team. Some of the requirements involved supporting multiple
                                    output formats, robust error checking, and some small quality of life features to ensure an efficient
                                    experience for the tool's users. The Event Pack creator was also part of a larger react project which
                                    added additional modularity and extensibility requirements.</p>

                                                    <p>Race to Destruction is a board game I worked on with a team of classmates.
                                                        Our main design goal was to make a game that was playable in around 30 min while
                                                        still maintaining strategic depth and allowing for moments of tension and suspense.
                                                        The basic premise is that each player controls a faction which is competing to collect
                                                        three components to a super-weapon that will allow them to eliminate their rivals.
                                                        Components spawn at random positions on the board and players have a number of methods
                                                        at their disposal to impede the progress of other players. My team was composed of four
                                                        individuals with me taking on the role of lead designer. You can find a link to the rulebook&nbsp;

                                                        <p>Extreme Concentration is based on the well-known match-2 card game This version
                                                            seeks to make the game significantly more difficult by requiring
                                                            the player to solve the whole board at once without any mistakes.
                                                            To balance the difficulty, players have a short period where they
                                                            can view every card and attempt to memorize their locations.
                                                            Once the timer on the period runs out, the cards will
                                                            flip back face-down and two cards will switch places with each other
                                                            at random.

                                                            I developed Extreme Concentration in Game Maker Studio and made all the art
